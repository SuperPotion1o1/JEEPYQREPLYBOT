# JEEPYQREPLYBOT
A praw based REDDIT bot which searches for 'pyq' as a keyword in the reddit sub : r/JEENEETards and replies to the user with a random JEE past year question.
To start contributing , you may either:
1)CREATE NEW ARRAYS IN Inorganicchemistry.py storing Single Correct Questions , followed by the 4 options in separate lists and a final array containing the correct option present in the 4 lists
   See Inorganicchemistry.py for an example

2)Suggest some changes to main.py to make the replying process more random and/or efficient .

3)CREATE NEW .py files of titles :
                            i> PHYSICALCHEMISTRY.py
                            ii>ORGANICCHEMISTRY.py
                            iii>PHYSICS.py
                            iv> MATHEMATICS.py
                            
                            all filled in the same fashion as Inorganicchemistry.py
                            
                            
4) Help in net scraping of the list elements rather than hard-coding them .
